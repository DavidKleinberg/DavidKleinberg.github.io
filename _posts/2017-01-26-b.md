During the summer of 2016, I interned for Clarity Advisors, a New York - Israeli consulting firm. I was assigned to their client, Hypertunity that specialized in lead generation software.
​
My primary objective was to build Hypertunity’s operations in the US.
​
My deliverables for the company included:

(1)	Competitive Analysis

(2)	Business Operating Plan

(3)	Collaterals

(4)	Email campaigns for MailChimp's platform

(5)	Two marketing videos
