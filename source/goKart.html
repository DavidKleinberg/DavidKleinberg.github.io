  <p><br />"Building your Customer Base" will bring you to the first video that went out with the email campaigns. I wrote the script based on Hypertunity's core marketing points, as discussed with the CEO and my experiences communicating with clients. <br /> <br /> I created the second video (above) based on the research our team conducted this summer, with a special thanks to my brother, Jacob Kleinberg, for his skills in film and animation.<br /> <br />*The images, music, and animations were all created from scratch again within a tight timeframe of 1-2 weeks to fit the deadline of the email campaigns.<br /><br /></p>
